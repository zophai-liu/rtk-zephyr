        RTL8752H COUNTER TIMER.
        Each Timer is part of a Timer Group and the number of available Timers
        is SoC-dependent. RTL8752H has 12 Timers available, 8 normal timer and
        4 advanced timer.

        In order to use one of the available timers on your application add
        a <board>.overlay file with contents as below

          &timer2 {
                  status = "okay";
                  prescaler = <1>;
          };

        From the above, setting 'status' is required while the prescaler is
        optional. Check below for more information on the prescaler.

      The prescaler value defines the factor by which the clock will be
      divided. The outcome of which serves as clock reference to the Timer
      itself.
