    RTL87X2G pin controller.
    The rtl87x2g pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling
    pin function selection and pin properties. For example, you can use this
    node to route UART2 TX to pin P3_2 and enable the pull-up resistor on the
    pin.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
       * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
       */
      &pinctrl {
        /* configuration for uart2 device, default state */
        uart2_default: uart2_default {
          /* group 1 ('group1' name is arbitrary) */
          group1 {
            /* configure P3_2 as UART_TX and P3_3 as UART_RX */
            psels = <RTL87X2G_PSEL(UART2_TX, P3_2, DIR_OUT, DRV_HIGH, PULL_UP)>,
                    <RTL87X2G_PSEL(UART2_RX, P3_3, DIR_IN, DRV_HIGH, PULL_UP)>;
          };
        };
      };

    The 'uart2_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
    particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
    state. You would specify the low-power configuration for the same device
    in a separate child node.

    As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
    Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'psels'
    property. The RTL87X2G_PSEL macro is used to specify a pin function selection
    and pin configuration. You could choose pinmux specificed function to
    specificed pin. And you could configure driver direction, driver state and
    pull state for the specificed pad. Available pin functions and configurations
    can be found in the include\zephyr\dt-bindings\pinctrl\rtl87x2g-pinctrl.h
    header file.

    To link this pin configuration with a device, use a pinctrl-N property
    for some number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS
    file:

       #include "rtl8762gn_evb-pinctrl.dtsi"

       &uart2 {
             pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_default>;
             pinctrl-names = "default";
       };
