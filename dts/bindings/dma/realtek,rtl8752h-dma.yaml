  RTL8752H DMA controller

  channel: Select channel for data transmitting

  slot: Handshake index, ref to rtl876x_gdma.h

  config: A 32bit mask specifying the DMA channel configuration
    - bit 0-1:     Direction  (see dma.h)
                 - 0x0: MEMORY to MEMORY
                 - 0x1: MEMORY to PERIPH
                 - 0x2: PERIPH to MEMORY
                 - 0x3: PERIPH to PERIPH(reserved)

    - bit 2-3:     Source address increase
                 - 0x0: increment address between transfers
                 - 0x1: decrement address between transfers
                 - 0x2: no address increment between transfers
                 - 0x3: reserved

    - bit 4-5:     Destination address increase
                 - 0x0: increment address between transfers
                 - 0x1: decrement address between transfers
                 - 0x2: no address increment between transfers
                 - 0x3: reserved

    - bit 6-7:     Source data width
                 - 0x0: 8 bits
                 - 0x1: 16 bits
                 - 0x2: 32 bits
                 - 0x3: reserved

    - bit 8-9:     Destination data width
                 - 0x0: 8 bits
                 - 0x1: 16 bits
                 - 0x2: 32 bits
                 - 0x3: reserved

    - bit 10-12:   Source data msize
                 - 0x0: msize 1
                 - 0x1: msize 4
                 - 0x2: msize 8
                 - 0x3: msize 16
                 - 0x4: msize 32
                 - 0x5: msize 64
                 - 0x6: msize 128
                 - 0x7: msize 256

    - bit 13-15:   Destination data width
                 - 0x0: msize 1
                 - 0x1: msize 4
                 - 0x2: msize 8
                 - 0x3: msize 16
                 - 0x4: msize 32
                 - 0x5: msize 64
                 - 0x6: msize 128
                 - 0x7: msize 256

    - bit 16-20:   Priority
                 - 0 ~ 9 can be configured

  Example of devicetree configuration

  &uart2 {
        status = "okay";
        dmas = <&dma0 0 19 0xa>, <&dma0 1 18 0x10021>;
        dma-names = "rx", "tx";
  };

  "uart2" uses dma0 for transmitting and receiving in the example.
  Each is named "rx" and "tx".
  The channel cell assigns channel 0 to receive and channel 1 to transmit.
  The slot cell configs specified handshake for different peripherals.
  The config cell can take various configs.
  But the setting used depends on each driver implementation.
  Set the priority for the transmitting channel as HIGH, LOW(the default) for receive channel.
